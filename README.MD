Gradient Boosting Laptop Price Predictor

This project uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor (from scikit-learn) to predict laptop prices based on specifications such as RAM size, SSD capacity, CPU performance score, and weight. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation (MAE & R² score), feature importance analysis, and an Actual vs Predicted plot.

Features:
Gradient Boosting Regression
Lightweight custom dataset
Feature Importance ranking
Visualization of Actual vs Predicted price
